}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An xsAnnotate object returned by CAMERA that needs 2D peak
grouping}

\item{mod.time}{The modulation time for the comprehensive 2D run}

\item{dead.time}{The time before the injection reaches the detector, defaults
to 0}

\item{rt.tol}{The grouping tolerance in the RT dimension}

\item{ppm.tol}{The grouping tolerance in the m/z direction}

\item{parallelized}{If true, runs grouping in parallel. Requires the future
package}
}
\value{
An xsAnnotate2D object with the added pspec2D slot
}
\description{
This function takes an xsAnnotate object produced by CAMERA and groups the
pseudospectrum groups according to their m/z's, 1D retention time, and 2D
retention time.
The default chromatographic/MS tolerances are 5s 2D RT tolerance and 20 ppm
m/z tolerance. Your system's mileage may vary.
